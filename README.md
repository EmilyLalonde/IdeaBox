# IdeaBox Redux

## Team: 1903 FEE - Emily Lalonde, Anneke McGrady, Andreea Hanson

### Project description:

Our task was to create a single page website, containing input elements that store values provided by the user.

### Website structure

Here is the link to our website: .......

Here is the structure of the website we built:

#### section 1 : 
- a side-bar containing the name of the website/project
- a button that filteres stared idea
- a select menu that filters through the qualities of the ideas
- an input field and a button to submit a new quality for the ideas
#### section 2
- the upper right side of the page is the input area, where the title and body inputs are located, as well as the submit button, that turns the user's inputs into a new Idea Card, that is shown in section 3
- there is also a search button and input field, so that the user can filter through ideas
#### section 3: 
- the lower right side of the page is the card area, where the cards are stored, updated, or deleted, depending on the user's actions (clicking on the buttons of the cards).

### Files

In order to accomplish the task, we have created 4 files(index.html, stylesheet.css, main.js, idea.js) containing the structure, the styling and the functionality of the page.
